# STEM-Workforce-Analysis


This program is created for the final project of the course Data Visualization in Spring 2020. 

It mainly analyzed the STEM workforce in the United States from 1997 to 2013 with Tableau and R. 

Since the dataset that I used are huge size, I just zipped the data set files for running the Tableau file.
